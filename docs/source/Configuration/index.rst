Configuring Constelation
===========================

Constellation divides the NoC specification into three orthogonal concerns.

 * **Physical specifications** describes the topology and microarchitecture of the NoC
 * **Flow specification** describes what flows the network might expect
 * **Routing specification** describes how flows traverse the physical resources of the NoC
